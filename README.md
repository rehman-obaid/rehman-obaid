### 🚀 PandaEditor
An easy to use, open-source 3D level / scene editor with a customizable architecture — so you can build your dream worlds your way. Runs smoothly on older hardware, and won’t cost you an organ to get started.

- Open-source freedom – no hidden limits or vendor lock-in.
- Customizable rendering and tools to match your creative vision.
- Built on Panda3D – battle-tested, lightweight, and powerful.
- C++ scripting for performance and flexibility.

### 🤖 Smart-StateMachine
**Redefine game AI with a smarter, goal-driven approach.**  
Forget spaghetti code and fragile, bloated behavior trees. Smart-StateMachine is a hierarchical, goal-oriented framework that unifies Utility AI, GOAP, and Behavior Trees into one clear, designer-friendly system.

Think in terms of goals and high-level actions, not tangled logic. Your AI stays modular, reactive, and believable — able to adapt on the fly to changing worlds, player actions, and narrative demands.

Build characters that feel alive, without the pain of maintaining complex AI graphs.
